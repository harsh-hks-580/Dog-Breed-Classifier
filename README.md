# Dog-Breed-Classifier

We are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs(subset of the IamgeNet dataset). Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal of the competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo.
